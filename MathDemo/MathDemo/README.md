# MathDemo - My First C# Math Operations Project

This is a simple C# console application that demonstrates basic math operations using the Math class in .NET. It's my first project to showcase DevOps skills, including Git version control and comments in code.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open in Visual Studio.
2. Build and run (F5).
3. The console will display the positive value, rounded value, and difference from PI.

## Code Example
```csharp
// From Program.cs
double positiveValue = Math.Abs(-3.556831);
Console.WriteLine($"Positive value: {positiveValue}");
// ... (rest of the code)
